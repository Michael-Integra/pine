The `rich-chat-room` example implements a full-featured chat room.

You can find the source code for this example at [https://github.com/elm-fullstack/elm-fullstack/tree/master/implement/example-apps/rich-chat-room](https://github.com/elm-fullstack/elm-fullstack/tree/master/implement/example-apps/rich-chat-room)

If you have copied (and modified) the code on your local file system, you can run the app with this command:

```cmd
elm-fullstack  run-server  --deploy-app-from=.
```

To run the app with the default source code:

```cmd
elm-fullstack  run-server  --deploy-app-from=https://github.com/elm-fullstack/elm-fullstack/tree/master/implement/example-apps/rich-chat-room
